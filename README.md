# Finder Pal - College Capstone Project

Welcome to the Finder Pal repository, a remarkable college capstone project focused on building an intelligent warehouse robot capable of automatic navigation, object recognition, and precise placement of items in predefined locations. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup and usage, guidelines for contributing, and licensing information.

## Project Overview

Finder Pal is a cutting-edge warehouse robot developed as part of our capstone project for the Computer Science Program at the University of Michigan Flint. This project showcases our proficiency in robotics, computer vision, and autonomous navigation technologies. The primary objectives of Finder Pal include:

- **Automatic Navigation:** The robot can autonomously navigate within a warehouse environment to locate items and destinations.

- **Object Recognition:** Utilizing camera recognition, the robot can identify objects and categorize them for efficient handling.

- **Precise Item Placement:** Finder Pal can accurately pick up items and place them in predefined locations within the warehouse.

### Configuration

To make the most of Finder Pal within your warehouse environment, you may consider the following configuration options:

1. **Map and Layout:** Create a basic outline of the interior of your warehouse. You can upload a map or blueprint of your warehouse to the app, marking important landmarks, item storage areas, and docking stations. This map will help Finder Pal understand the layout and optimize its navigation.

2. **Object Database:** Populate the object recognition database with the types of objects commonly found in your warehouse. You can provide images and descriptions of items to improve the robot's object recognition accuracy. The more comprehensive the database, the more efficient Finder Pal becomes in identifying and handling items.

3. **Waypoints and Destinations:** Define waypoints and destinations within your warehouse. You can set up specific points where the robot should go for various tasks. Whether it's for picking up items, delivering items, or performing inspections, configuring these waypoints streamlines Finder Pal's operations.

4. **Safety Zones:** Implement safety zones and restricted areas within your warehouse to ensure safe and controlled robot movement. These configurations can help avoid collisions and ensure that the robot operates safely around human workers.

5. **Alerts and Notifications:** Configure alerts and notifications to keep you informed about the robot's progress and any issues that may arise during its operations. You can set up real-time alerts for tasks completion, low battery, or unexpected obstacles.

By carefully configuring Finder Pal according to your warehouse's specific requirements, you can maximize its efficiency and adapt it to your unique operational needs. Our user-friendly interface and intuitive tools make this process straightforward.


## Usage

Finder Pal can be used for various applications in the warehousing industry. Here are some key features and how to use them:

1. **Automatic Navigation:**
   
Set a route and the robot will follow it.
  
To set a route for Finder Pal, you can use our user-friendly interface or API. Define waypoints and destinations within the warehouse, and the robot will autonomously navigate the most efficient path to reach its destination. You can also monitor its progress in real- time using the control dashboard.

3. **Object Recognition:**
   
Decide what object the robot should find.
   
Finder Pal's object recognition system is highly adaptable. Specify the type or category of objects you want the robot to identify through our intuitive configuration interface. The robot's onboard cameras and AI algorithms will then scan the environment, identify the target objects, and provide real-time feedback on their locations, quantities, and conditions.

5. **Precise Item Placement:**
   
Finder Pal ensures precise and gentle item placement in predefined locations within the warehouse. Our system allows you to program item-specific placement instructions, including orientation, stacking, and safety measures. The robot's advanced gripper and sensors guarantee the secure handling and accurate positioning of items, reducing the risk of damage and optimizing warehouse efficiency.
