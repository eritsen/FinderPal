https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases
This need to be put in a folder labeled "DataSets" in the same directory as the script.

the SetUpModel() function to reflect the correct model.

CameraFeed() - Displays live camera feed with object detection
ImageCompare() - Compares two images for similarity and returns a percentage.
SetUpModel() - Sets up the model you want to use.
